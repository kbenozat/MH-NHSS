### Overview

Through our Alliance's partnerships with [OD2A](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/od2a/index.html) and [Habilitat](https://www.habilitat.com/), analyzing data collected by [SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/) has become a pilliar of our research

[Kodi Benoza](https://github.com/kbenozat) began her URE by analyzing data from the [National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS)](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/n-mhss-national-mental-health-services-survey)

We then pivoted to mapping data from the [2022 National Directory Of Mental Health Treatment Facilities](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/national-directory-of-mental-health-treatment-facilities) with the [mapView R package.](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview) This is the map visualized below


### Next steps

Our team is exploring the utilization of machine learning for optimal mental health facility location
